# Frontend Mentor Projects

Frontend Mentor provides real world challenges for frontend developers to improve there skills and recieve feedback from others. I have enjoyed working on these projects, they have allowed me to practice matching a design I did not come up with and have helped me practice foundational JavaScript skills.
